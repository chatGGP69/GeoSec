## 🚀 Key Features

- Interactive GUI for drawing and visualizing geological layers
- Modular design, separating frontend, logic, and data models
- Supports topography, rock layers, and geological contacts
- Generates clear visual geological sections for education and research

## 🏗️ Project Status

The core functionality is up and running, including the ability to build geological sections interactively. I’m currently working on adding more advanced features, such as:

- Fold and fault visualization
- Export options
- UI enhancements
- Unit tests

This is an ongoing project, with plans to improve and expand its capabilities over time.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

GeoSec was created as part of my studies in Earth Sciences and Computer Science at Ben-Gurion University. It’s been a great opportunity to combine my interests in coding and geology — bringing computational tools into geological analysis.

Through this project, I’ve strengthened my skills in:

- Python programming
- Building modular, scalable code
- GUI development
- Scientific visualization and data handling
